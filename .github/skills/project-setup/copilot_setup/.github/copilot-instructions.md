# GitHub Copilot Instructions - ConceptAlchemy

## ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT PURPOSE

**Project Name**: ConceptAlchemy  
**Framework**: next-js  
**Description**: Interactive vector-based lyric exploration tool using pgvector for semantic search and AI-assisted composition

**CRITICAL**: This project inherits universal coding standards from the Master Workspace while maintaining project-specific patterns and conventions.

---

## Environment
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Shell**: PowerShell (use `;` for command chaining, never `&&`)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with npm (if applicable)
- **Framework**: next-js

---

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PLATFORM RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS)

### 1. NEVER START/STOP/MANAGE DEV SERVERS
**This is non-negotiable.** Agents must NEVER:
- Run `npm run dev`, `npm start`, or any development server commands
- Start Python servers, Node servers, .NET servers, etc.
- Manage processes with `pm2`, `forever`, or similar tools
- Kill, stop, or restart any running services

**USER ONLY**: The user starts and manages all development servers. If a task requires running a server, tell the user what command to run and let them execute it.

**Exception**: Running one-off commands (build, test, linting) in a fresh terminal is acceptable. Background dev servers are NOT.

### 2. Core Development Rules (Inherited from Master Workspace)

#### Universal TypeScript Standards
- **NEVER use `any` types** - all types must be explicitly defined
- **No type scattering** - avoid duplicate type definitions across files
- **Strongly typed objects/classes only** - prefer interfaces and Zod schemas
- Keep files under 500 lines - split into multiple modules if needed

#### Git Workflow
- **Always create checkpoints before significant changes**: `git add .; git commit -m "checkpoint: before [change]"`
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why"
- Confirm multi-step plans with user before executing

#### AI-First Development Philosophy
- Prefer AI/LLM solutions over programmatic approaches when applicable
- Keep LLM prompts separate from core business logic
- Never write mock/fallback implementations unless explicitly requested
- Use "Not Implemented" placeholders for incomplete features

#### PowerShell Syntax (Windows)
- Use `;` for command chaining (NEVER `&&`)
- Native PowerShell cmdlets preferred
- Example: `git add .; git commit -m "message"`

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Database
- **Type**: postgresql
- **Connection**: Use environment variables in `.env.local` or `.env`
- **Schema**: See `PDR.md` for data models

### Services
- **Integrations**: openai,anthropic
- **API Keys**: Store in environment variables, never commit to git

### File Organization
- Core logic: `src/lib/` (or equivalent for framework)
- Components: `src/components/` (for UI frameworks)
- API routes: `app/api/` (for Next.js) or appropriate framework pattern
- Test files: `tests/` or framework-specific test directories

## Common Commands (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\cclem\Dropbox\Source\Projects-{{PROJECT_YEAR}}\ConceptAlchemy

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt, dotnet restore, etc.

# âš ï¸ DO NOT RUN - User starts the dev server
# npm run dev  # or python src/main.py, dotnet run, etc.
# â†’ Tell the user what command to run; they execute it in their terminal

# Git checkpoint (use semicolon, not &&)
git add .; git commit -m "checkpoint: before refactor"

# Run tests (one-off command, acceptable)
npm test  # or pytest, dotnet test, etc.

# Run build (one-off command, acceptable)  
npm run build  # or dotnet build, python -m build, etc.
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Convention
- Create test files in `tests/` directory
- For Next.js: Create test pages in `app/tests/` for rapid iteration
- Follow framework-specific testing patterns

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints thoroughly
- Verify database connections
- Validate external service integrations

## Portfolio Context

**Note**: This project is part of a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating:
- Modern development practices
- Clean architecture patterns
- Production-ready code quality

When explaining this project:
- Emphasize technical decisions and trade-offs
- Reference architectural patterns in `PDR.md`
- Highlight problem-solving approaches

## Important Notes

- **Reference PDR.md** for architectural patterns and design decisions
- **Reference 'brand-identity' skill** for styling and UI consistency
- **Maintain strong typing** throughout the codebase
- **Follow PowerShell syntax** (`;` not `&&`)
- **Test incrementally** - create test pages/files as you develop
- **Git checkpoints** before major changes
- **Ask before structural changes** - confirm with user
